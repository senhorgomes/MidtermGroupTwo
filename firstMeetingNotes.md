# Planning

Today we covered a few things in planning for your midterm.
For your midterm you will want to spend as much time as possible planning the app before coding it. This is to ensure you have a solid vision of what you want to build. By planning, you are also preventing yourself from backtracking and having to rebuild major components of the app. 
Here are a couple things you should do for planning:

## What are user stories?

In software development and product management, a user story is an informal, natural language description of features of a software system.

- As a user, I want to be able to make polls for my friends

- As a user, I want to be able to share my polls to friends

- As a user, I want to be able to see the results of those polls, and have them only visible to me

- As a user, I want a nightmode for my app

## Prototype(MVP)

MVP, minimal viable product. An app that does the bare minimum and meets the requirements

How many of the user stories, are requirements?

Stretch â†’ Things that we want to work on after the MVP is done.

## Wireframe

- Visuals of what the app would look like, and the flow of its content. Great websites for this would be Figma, Diagrams.net, or any other tool you would like to use to draw

## ERD 

- Entity Relationship Diagram. How the tables are connected together, it will define your database

## Git Repo setup

We also went over the github repo setup.
Remember, only one person forks the LHL repo, and everyone else will clone that group members fork.
Example:
Group Member A forks the LHL repo, Group Member B and C will clone Group Member A's repo.
You will all be working out of one repo. You can invite people as collaborators for the repo by following this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)
Whenever you are working on a new feature, create a new branch. Please avoid working on the main branch as you may lose your work, or your other group members work

## Dividing up the workflow

[Trello](https://trello.com/) and Github provides tools for your group to organize the workflow of your app. You can see who is working on what, and what is left on the to-do list. You can leave notes for other group members as well.

Best of luck everyone!
