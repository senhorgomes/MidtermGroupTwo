# Planning

For your midterm you will want to spend as much time as possible planning the app before coding it. This is to ensure you have a solid vision of what you want to build. By planning, you are also preventing yourself from backtracking and having to rebuild major components of the app. 
Here are a couple things you should do for planning:

# Listing out the requirements for the app

All in a google doc.


## What are user stories?

In software development and product management, a user story is an informal, natural language description of features of a software system.


## Wikimaps
MVP
- As a user, I want to be able to create a map with my favourite coffee shops // CREATE => POST /maps
- As a user, I want to be able to edit the maps I create

Stretch goals
- As a user, I want to have a 3D model of the map, something like VR

If we're done with the app a week before, then you can work on implementing stretch features


## Prototype(MVP)

MVP, minimal viable product. An app that does the bare minimum and meets the requirements

How many of the user stories, are requirements?

Stretch â†’ Things that we want to work on after the MVP is done.

## ERD 

- Entity Relationship Diagram. How the tables are connected together, it will define your database
What information will I need to get the features I want?
Tables, FK, PK

## Routes

You will not need to create a register page or a login page.
You can hardcode your login users.

/login/:id GET ROUTE
 -> /login/1
 -> A cookie with the id of 1 will be stored
 -> All pages would display and be used as user 1
/logout
 -> Clear the cookie and redirect

- CRUD
Maps
- Create -> /maps POST
- Read -> /maps or a single map /maps/:id
- Update ->
- Delete ->

Users
- Create -> /order POST
- Read -> /orders or a single order /order/:id
- Update ->
- Delete ->

## Wireframe

- Visuals of what the app would look like, and the flow of its content. Great websites for this would be [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [Diagrams.net](https://www.drawio.com/), or any other tool you would like to use to draw

## Git Repo setup

We also went over the github repo setup.
Remember, only one person forks the LHL repo, and everyone else will clone that group members fork.
Example:
Group Member A forks the LHL repo, Group Member B and C will clone Group Member A's repo.
You will all be working out of one repo. You can invite people as collaborators for the repo by following this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)
Whenever you are working on a new feature, create a new branch. Please avoid working on the main branch as you may lose your work, or your other group members work

## Dividing up the workflow

[Trello](https://trello.com/) and Github provides tools for your group to organize the workflow of your app. You can see who is working on what, and what is left on the to-do list. You can leave notes for other group members as well.

# Node version

Stay on 16
nvm install 16
nvm alias default 16

Best of luck everyone!
